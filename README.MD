The project is a sample implementation exploring Spring AI capabilities.
All the foundations AI models are assumed to be running locally.
Langfuse also is assumed to be running locally
Extensions can be made if hosted AI models are required by simply adding the required API keys which are complaient with Open AI standard

The code samples are an implementation of following the Spring AI in action book
but it is not a simple copy paste.
Many modifications are in place which was found in course of learning.

**The secret and keys you see in the checked in code are from my locally hosted machine and it will not be useful elsewhere.
So please make changes as per your requirement and any attempt to use these keys will be a simple timewaste **
